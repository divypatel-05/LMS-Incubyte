# Library Management System (Assessment)

This is a simple library management system entirely implemented using a Test Driven Development (TDD) approach. It allows users to perform basic operations such as adding books, borrowing books, and viewing available books. The application is implemented using JavaScript.

## TDD (Test-Driven Development)

Test-Driven Development (TDD) is a software development approach where developers write tests for functionality before writing the actual implementation code. It emphasizes a cycle of writing a test, writing the minimum code to make the test pass, and then refining the code. 

### Three Laws of TDD:

1. **Write only enough code to fail the test**  
2. **Write only the test necessary to pass the test**  
3. **Refactor the code**

## Running the tests

### Run All Tests

To execute all tests, use the following command:

  ```bash
  npm test
  ```

### Run Specific Tests

To test individual functionalities, use the following commands:

1. Add Book functionality tests:
